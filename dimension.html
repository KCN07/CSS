1. The cow is a domestic animal which is found all over the world. It has four legs, two horns on its head, and a long tail. Its body is covered with soft hairs. Its hoofs are parted in the middle. Cows may be of various colours. They may be white, yellowish white, brown, black or a mixture of these colours. They are gentle and timid by nature.

2. The cow is a very useful animal. It gives us milk which is very nutritious. From the milk, we make butter, curd, ghee, sweetmeats etc. It lives on grass, leaves and bran. The bullocks are engaged by us in manifold jobs. They draw carts which carry load of men and goods. They plough lands; and sometimes they are yoked to a grinding tree for extract­ing oil from seeds.

3. The cow is a common domestic animal, because of its various types of usefulness. Even the cow-dung is a good fertilizer which is generally used in the fields for better growth of crops. When the cow dies, its skin is used in mak­ing shoes, bags etc. Its bones are used in making buttons, combs, knife-handles and similar other useful articles.

4. Thus the cow is the most popular domestic animal in the world.<br/><br/>
